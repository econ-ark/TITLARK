Hands-On Heterogeneous Agent Macroeconomics Using the
[Econ-ARK/HARK](http://econ-ark.org) Toolkit

[Christopher D. Carroll](http://www.econ2.jhu.edu/people/ccarroll)

Syllabus for Hands-On Heterogeneous Agent Macroeconomics

BI Business School/University of Oslo

Spring, 2020

Because Representative Agent (‘RA’) models were not useful for
understanding much of what happened in the Great Recession, policymakers
including Larry [Summers](#XsummersWolf2) ([2011](#XsummersWolf2)), Fed
Chair Janet [Yellen](#XyellenHetero) ([2016](#XyellenHetero)), former
IMF Chief Economist Olivier
[Blanchard](#XblanchardDSGE) ([2016](#XblanchardDSGE)), ECB Governing
Board Member Benoit [Coeure](#XcoeureHetero) ([2013](#XcoeureHetero)),
and Bank of England Chief Economist
Andy [Haldane](#XhaldaneDappled) ([2016](#XhaldaneDappled)) have
suggested that incorporation of heterogeneity (for example, across
borrowers and lenders) must be an essential part of the agenda in
developing new and better models. In confirmation of that intuition, a
number of recent papers, most notably [Kaplan, Moll, and
Violante](#XkmvHANK) ([2018](#XkmvHANK)) and [Krueger, Mitman, and
Perri](#XkmpHandbook) ([2016](#XkmpHandbook)), have developed models
that include a realistic description of microeconomic heterogeneity, and
have shown that such models can generate more sensible macroeconomic
implications than RA models for important questions like the operation
of fiscal and monetary policy.

This course will provide a hands-on introduction to the construction of
models with ‘serious’ heterogeneity (that is, heterogeneity that matches
the microeconomic facts that theory suggests should matter for
macroeconomic outcomes like consumption dynamics); why such
heterogeneous agent (‘HA’) models have implications different from those
of RA models; and how existing HA models can be adapted to new
questions. (‘Hands-On’ means that students with their own laptops will
run the and experiment with the code that solves these models in class.)

The course will have two main elements: Lectures explaining the
conceptual foundations of the models work; and hands-on demonstrations
of live working versions of such models using the open-source
[Econ-ARK/HARK](http://econ-ark.org/HARK) toolkit.

Students should bring a laptop on which they have permissions to install
and run new software. Prior to class, on that laptop, students should
have installed the
[anaconda3](https://www.anaconda.com/what-is-anaconda/) stack, which is
a distribution of python 3 that includes a robust set of extra tools
that are useful for doing computational work. A good guide to installing
anaconda is
[here](https://github.com/mmcky/nyu-econ-370/blob/master/install-local-guide.pdf).

(In “readings” below, starred readings are strongly suggested)

### 1  Preliminaries

Certain things must be done to prepare for running everything on your
own computer

#### 1.1  Option 1: Do Everything On Your Own Computer’s OS

1.  Install [Anaconda](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install):
    [https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install)
2.  Get Git
    -   [Get the command-line
        tool](https://atlassian.com/git/tutorials/install-git):
        -   [https://atlassian.com/git/tutorials/install-git](https://atlassian.com/git/tutorials/install-git)
    -   [Get a GitHub Account](https://github.com/join)
    -   [Download the GitHub Desktop App](https://desktop.github.com)
        -   And connect it to your online GitHub account
3.  [Install HARK](https://github.com/econ-ark/HARK#content-install)
    -   Follow the instructions for installing HARK for Anaconda
4.  Clone the [DemARK](https://github.com/econ-ark/DemARK) and
    [REMARK](https://github.com/econ-ark/REMARK) repos
    -   git clone https://github.com/econ-ark/DemARK
    -   git clone https://github.com/econ-ark/REMARK
5.  Using python from the command line:
    -   pip install nose
    -   python -c ’import HARK ; print(HARK.\_\_file\_\_)’
    -   cd \[root directory for HARK\]
    -   python -m nose

#### 1.2  Option 2: Do Everything On a Virtual Machine

1.  Find (or buy) free space of at least 100 GB
    -   A FAST flash/pen drive is fine (not a slow one)
2.  Follow the instructions [for installing your
    VM](https://github.com/econ-ark/econ-ark-tools/tree/master/Virtual/Machine/VirtualBox)

### 2  Motivation

Models with serious microfoundations yield fundamentally different
conclusions than RA models about core questions in macroeconomics.

1.  How monetary policy works
    -   HA channels account for most of the mechanism of monetary
        transmission
2.  Whether fiscal policy works
    -   ‘serious’ HA models are consistent with evidence of MPC’s of 0.5
3.  What made the Great Recession Great
    -   RA models: Mostly a supply shock
    -   HA models: Mostly a demand shock

    -   This discussion of that paper puts the relationship of HA to RA
        models in context.

### 3  The Relation Between Micro and Macro Models

#### 3.1  The Relation Between Micro and Macro Models

It has become clear in the last decade (and especially in the last few
years) that the micro and macro parts of the HA macro problem are
surprisingly independent. HA macro models can be solved by first using
powerful tools to find the steady state of the micro problem, and then
using other tools to calculate how the micro solution changes over the
business cycle. Relatively small – or even linear – changes to even a
highly nonlinear microeconomic problem can result in quantitatively
plausible macroeconomic dynamics. p Readings:

### 4  Micro Models

#### 4.1  Micro Consumption Theory Refresher

The course will assume that students are familiar with standard
quantitative tools for solving RA models, like DYNARE. The bulk of the
“hands-on” part of the course will therefore involve learning and using
tools for solving micro problems with ‘serious’ microfoundations.

modeling. Students will be taught how to use the toolkit to solve
increasingly sophisticated models, starting with partial equilibrium
perfect foresight models and ending with some exercises using a full
general equilibrium micro-macro model with idiosyncratic and aggregate
risks.

#### 6.5  Hands-On with Real HA Models

For an economy in steady state (that is, with constant factor prices
like interest rates and wages), models with ‘serious’ income
heterogeneity have been solvable in partial equilibrium since about 1990
([Zeldes](#XzeldesStochastic) ([1989](#XzeldesStochastic)),
[Deaton](#XdeatonLiqConstr) ([1991](#XdeatonLiqConstr))). Calculating an
equilibrium distribution of wealth that results from those policy
functions and matching it to the total amount of observed wealth (and a
corresponding interest rate) was first done by [Hubbard, Skinner, and
Zeldes](#Xhsz:importance) ([1994](#Xhsz:importance)) using a
supercomputer. [Aiyagari](#Xaiyagari:ge) ([1994](#Xaiyagari:ge))
proposed a radically simple model that did not attempt to match the
distributions of wealth and income, but could be solved without a
supercomputer.

In a rational expectations steady state, there are no expected changes
in interest rates, wages, or the distribution. Aggregate fluctuations
make calculation of an RE equilibrium massively more difficult, because:

1.  Meaningful aggregate fluctuations will change the distribution of
    wealth and income
2.  The amount of aggregate saving depends on how aggregate wealth and
    income are distributed
3.  The amount of saving determines future factor prices
4.  In principle, RE therefore requires that everyone know the entire
    distribution of wealth, income, and any other state variables in the
    population

The problem therefore suffers from a severe case of the “curse of
dimensionality.” (That is, it’s really hard!). The first paper to tackle
the problem was [Krusell and Smith](#XksHetero) ([1998](#XksHetero)).
Work by [Bayer and Luetticke](#XblSolving) ([2018](#XblSolving)) builds
on all of the prior work to construct a reasonable HANK model that can
be solved in a few minutes on a laptop. The key contribution of [Krusell
and Smith](#XksHetero) ([1998](#XksHetero)) was to discover that, in
practice, highly accurate predictions of future aggregate states could
be made using only the mean of the current aggregate capital stock

Notebook:
[KrusellSmith.ipynb](https://econ-ark.org/materials/KrusellSmith.ipynb)

#### 6.6  The Micro Steady State and Macro Fluctuations

A problem with solving methods using the original Krusell Smith method
is that the computational challenge was so great that only the simplest
such models could be solved, and the ability to construct standard tools
like impulse response functions to aggregate shocks was very limited.

[Reiter](#XreiterSolving) ([2009](#XreiterSolving)) showed how to solve
such problems several orders of magnitude faster; the essence of his
idea was to solve the micro problem for the steady-state distribution,
and then capture business cycle fluctuations by figuring out how to
perturb the decision rules and the distribution appropriately.

Building on his work, the last few years have seen great further strides
in speed and power of such tools.

### 7  Take Home Exam

The exam in this class will be a take-home exam in which the students
will be expected to use the modeling techniques they have learned to
make a meaningful substantive extension of one of the models they have
learned in class. Their code will be tested to determine whether it
works, and then judged on the basis of how well the extension has been
done.
