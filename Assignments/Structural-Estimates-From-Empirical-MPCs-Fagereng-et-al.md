# Structural-Estimates-From-Empirical-MPCs-Fagereng-et-al

This assignment asks you to solve some problems posed in a notebook in the "QuARK" repo ("Questions made using the ARK")

Your assignment is:

1. On [GitHub.com](https://github.com), Log into your GitHub account from a browser (FireFox is the VM's default)
1. Navigate to https://github.com/econ-ark/QuARK, and make a fork of the QuARK repo
   * Click the "Fork" button on the right
1. Clone your fork to your local machine:
   * `cd ~/GitHub/[your-GitHub-ID] ; git clone https://github.com/[your-GitHub-ID]/QuARK`
1. (If you already had a local clone of a fork of the QuARK repo, perhaps in `~/GitHub/econ-ark-forks` you should update it (though you should use the clone of your own fork for the assignment; updating in `econ-ark-forks` is purely so that you can have the original version as a reference)
   * Google should tell you the commands you need to use: Search "how do I update my fork of a repo with changes to the upstream source repo"
   * The term for the original repo, is the "upstream" repo
   * If you can't figure out how to do this, you can
      1. Delete the original fork from last week
		 * Do this both on GitHub.com and on our local machine
	  1. Make a new fork
   * Please do NOT make a new fork without first deleting your original fork
      * GitHub keeps track of all the forks
	  * It becomes hopelessly confusing if one person has several forks
1. In your local copy of your fork of the QuARK, you will find in the notebooks directory `Structural-Estimates-From-Empirical-MPCs-Fagereng-et-al-Problems.ipynb`
	  * `cd ~/GitHub/[your-GitHub-ID]/QuARK/notebooks`
   1. Make a branch called '[your-github-username]Solutions'
	  * if I were a student: `git checkout -b ccarrollATjhueconSolutions`
   1. In the branch, make a copy and make it writeable:
      * `cp Structural-Estimates-From-Empirical-MPCs-Fagereng-et-al-Problems.ipynb Structural-Estimates-From-Empirical-MPCs-Fagereng-et-al-Problems-And-Solutions.ipynb`
	  * `chmod u+w Structural-Estimates-From-Empirical-MPCs-Fagereng-et-al-Problems-And-Solutions.ipynb`
   1. Open the notebook
      * `jupyter notebook` from the command line in the notebooks directory
   1.  Read through this notebook, and create (or fill in) "SOLUTION" cells after the "PROBLEM" cells
1. When you have finished solving the problem:
   1. "push" your local copy to the your "remote" version of your fork at your ID on GitHub.com
   1. In your browser, return to your GitHub.com account, issue a "pull request" to the upstream QuARK repo
