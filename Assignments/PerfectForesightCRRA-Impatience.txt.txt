# Effects of 'Impatience' On Consumption Function

The notebook [PerfForesightCRRA-Impatience-Problems](https://github.com/econ-ark/QuARK/blob/master/notebooks/PerfForesightCRRA-Impatience-Problems.ipynb) asks you to explore the relationship between various impatience factors and the consumption function.

In your [Virtual Machine](https://github.com/econ-ark/econ-ark-tools/tree/master/Virtual/Machine/VirtualBox), your assignment is:

1. Change to the `GitHub/econ-ark` directory
1. `git clone https://github.com/econ-ark/TITLARK` to get the teaching tools repo
1. `cd TITLARK/notebooks`
1. Obtain a local copy of the notebook. Options:
   1. Go to the link above, and click 'Raw' to see a text version; then "Save As ..." text to `TITLARK/notebooks`
   1. `curl -L https://raw.githubusercontent.com/econ-ark/QuARK/master/notebooks/PerfForesightCRRA-Impatience-Problems.ipynb`
1. Make a copy of the notebook to put your solutions in:
   * `cp PerfForesightCRRA-Impatience-Problems.ipynb PerfForesightCRRA-Impatience-Problems-And-Solutions.ipynb`
1. From the command line,
   * launch a `jupyter notebook`
   * read through your `-And-Solutions` copy of the notebook
   * after any code cell containing `# PROBLEM`:
	  * You should create a code cell that begins with the text `# SOLUTION`
      * These should contain your code for answering the corresponding question
